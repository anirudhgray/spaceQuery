# Project Overview
At its core, this webapp (I've named it **spaceQuery**) acts as an app for querying a bunch of awesome space related APIs (more info below). It doesn't sound nearly as awesome now that I have written it down, but yeah. Why do I need to be logged in, you ask? Well, I've added some nifty functionality which allows you to save any query results that you particularly like to your user profile for later reference â€” can't do that without having you signed in. This also allows you to look up other users and look at their saved posts. I'm not entirely sure why I added this, and what purpose it serves, but it's there. Further explanation below.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity
I believe this project is **sufficiently distinct** from the others in the course, and is not based on the 2020 CS50W Pizza project.
- It is not, at it's core, a social media website (while it does incorporate features such as user profiles, they are more of a secondary thing).
- Nor is it an e-commerce based webapp in any way. In fact, it has nothing to do with commerce at all.
- It utilises a javascript frontend framework (Vue) alongside Django Rest Framework on the server side, which add to the projects distinctiveness.

It is also **more complex** than the other projects in the course.
- As said above, it utilises Vue and Django Rest Framework.
- It also incorporates heavy usage of multiple third party APIs (for maps and other data).
